Forum assignment question

Random 15 numbers from 1 to 30 as samples

You could ONLY use the same number ONCE.

Known that the standard number for the given variety is Âµ=18.



Test whether your randomized numbers are significantly better than the standard results.

To do that, please follow this steps:

Step 1: Define the Null and Alternate Hypothesis

Step 2: Calculate the mean

Step 3: Calculate sample standard deviation

Step 4: Calculate the Test Statistic (T)

Step 5: with Confidence level = 0.95, alpha=0.05, Find the T-Critical from T Table (find on the internet)
